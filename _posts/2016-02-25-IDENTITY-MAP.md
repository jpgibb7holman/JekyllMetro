IDENTITY MAPS

     IN OUR LESSON WE HAD GONE AROUND LOOKING AT EACH OTHER'S IDENTITY MAPS AND WERE TOLD THAT FOR HOMEWORK WE WERE GOUNG TO AWNSWER SOME QUESTIONS ON OUR BLOG.

Q.  HOW WAS IT TO CREATE YOUR IDENTITY MAP?

A.  IT WAS OKAY AND SOME PARTS WERE QUITE FUN BUT OTHER PARTS WERE SLIGHTLY LESS SO.

Q. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT SHARING YOUR MAP WITH THE CLASS?

A.  QUITE GOOD BUT SOME PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS ON THERE AND PARTS I WOULD NOT HAVE SHARED OTHERWISE.

Q. HOW DID IT FEEL TO COMMENT ON THE MAPS?

A. I ENJOYED COMMENTING BECAUSE WE WERE FREE TO SAY WHAT WE THOUGHT AS LONG AS IT WAS NOT ABUSIVE. WE WERE ALSO MEANT TO WRITE WHAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MAP AND NOT THE PERSON WHO CREATED IT. 

Q.  DID YOU ENJOY THIS PROCESS OR WOULD YOU HAVE RATHER ASKED QUESTIONS AND COMMENTED DIRECTLY TO THE STUDENT AS WE SOMETIMES DO IN CLASS PRESENTATIONS?

A.  I ENJOYED THIS WAY AS YOU WOULDN'T BE EMBARASSED IS SOMEONE THOUGHT YOUR MAP WAS RUBBISH.

Q. HOW DID IT FEEL TO GET THE COMMENTS BACK? WERE THERE ANY SUPRISES?

A. IT FELT GOOD TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK AS MOST OF MINE WERE GOOD. THERE WERE NOT ANY SUPRIRSES.

Q.HOW IS THIS PROCESS DIFFERENT FROM COMMENTING ON SOMETHING ONLINE WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE THE PERSON?

A. BECAUS YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE MAP ONLINE AND HAVE NO IDEA IF ANY OF IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE.

Q. DID YOUR IDENTITY MAP CREATE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO POST MORE OR LESS OF IN THE FUTURE?

A. I DONT USE SOCIAL MEDIA SO I CAN'T AWNSWER THAT

Q. IS THERE ANY OTHER CHANGES YOU WOULD MAKE IN THE MEDIA USED BASED ON THIS ACTIVITY

A. NOT REALLY.

Q. DID THESE 6 LESSONS CHANGE HOW YOU VIEW SOCIAL MEDIA? IF SO, HOW?

A. THEY DID. I USED TO THINK SOCIAL MEDIA WAS ONLY DANGEROUS IF YOU GAVE AWAY ALL YOUR DETAILS BUT IT COULD JUST BE 1 THING. YOU COULD ALSO POST 1 THING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED RACIST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT COULD CATCH UP WITH YOU IN LATER LIFE AND STOP YOU GETTING A GOOD JOB.

Q. DID THE LESSONS CHANGE HOW YOU PLAN TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE FUTURE? IF SO, HOW?

A. NOT REALLY. I WAS NEVER GOING TO POST STUFF THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED RUDE.
