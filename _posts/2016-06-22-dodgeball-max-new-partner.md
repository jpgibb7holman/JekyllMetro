     We have started to get deeper code in our javascript games. Our big problem at the moment is trying to get the avatar to move. We have tried many different things such as the x and y axis positions and random number sequences but all of them have not worked. I have got a new partner but we have not had to change our game which is very good. The games are very frustrating but we will hopefully finish them soon.
