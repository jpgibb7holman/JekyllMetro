    <td>I learnt by following the book, then using logic (following the pattern of the previous codes) or trial and error to complete as many levels as we could from the booklet. We also tried to do the challenges, so doing a bit extra without as much help as some other parts.

    <td>When we got stuck on some of the harder levels that slowed us down so we could not complete some of the levels we could have done if those levels had not slowed us down as much as it did.</td>
