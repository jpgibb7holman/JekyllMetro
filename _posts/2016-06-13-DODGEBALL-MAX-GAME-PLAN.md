DODGEBALL MAX GAME PLAN

   In our IT lesson today we had moved rooms so we got to use Apple Macs which everyone was excited about but in the actual lesson we had to make a game plan and start the coding for a game on a BBC Microbit using Java script. My game was called DODGEBALL MAX and involved you being a dot on the center of the screen and having to dodge dots that came from the top and bottom of the screen. 

    It was easy enough to do the first steps such as creating the avatars but got harder when we had to make the levels, lives etc.
