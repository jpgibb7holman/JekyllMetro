JAVA SCRIPT CODING

    Java script is a coding language that can be used for many things but me and my class use it for the BBC micro:bit. This is something that you would programme to do certain things and then put into a computer. We did some tutorials on it such as Flashpoint and Worst Snake Ever. then we would do what the button says and then the micro:bit would perform a series of events that you had programmed it to do.
