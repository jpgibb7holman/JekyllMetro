  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt mostly by a trial-and-error strategy, so trying many different things until I found one that worked and this was probably the most successful. I also tried to use logic and figure out the problem by thinking it through methodically which worked as well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by the fact that I had never used that particular type of code before so I had to work harder than some people. The layout of the Fuze box was quite confusing as well so that limited me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would try to refer to the guide more because I wanted to finish quickly and move on to other things but when I did refer to the guide it helped a lot. I would ask for help if I get completely stuck but would try to persevere before that. </td>
