AN ODD IT LESSON

     Our recent IT lesson was more like  biology lesson. Our teacher started talking about the dangers of revenge porn which then led on to sex and some odd things to be duscussing in an IT lesson. He told ud that he would rather us know early than be told about it after we came into contact with such things and that the vast a lot of the stuff is on the internet so it all ties in together.
