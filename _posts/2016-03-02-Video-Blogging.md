Video Blogging

     Today we watched a video about video blogging and how bad it can be. In the video a brother challenges his sister to a battle about who can get a million views in the video channel sooner. It then gave you the option to do the challenge or not. We clicked yes and at first the video was all a bit of fun but then things got a bit more serious and led to a catastrophic event in which the brother was doing something rather naughty with his and the guy who was helping his sister filmed it and posted it online.

     This led to him falling out with all his friends, the brother and his girlfriend splitting up, the girlfriend got a load of stick and then everyone got bored of it and left her alone, and the person who filmed being bullied for a bit. They all turned out happy though, as the person who filmed  found a site that helped and made up with his friends and  the girlfriend went to a counsillor and was fine
