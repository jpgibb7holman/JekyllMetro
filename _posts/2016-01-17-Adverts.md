ADVERTS

       Today we learnt about media and adverts. We were told to analyze the advert and work out the target market, The subtext (the hidden or underlying message) and the information that has been left out of the advert. We watched the Kia exercising hamsters advert where they showed some really fat and unfit hamsters getting fitter and exercising in the gym. Then it showed them going to a red carpet event and arriving in the new Kia car. It then showed the words "Totally transformed".

        

        The underlying message was that the same transformation that was happening to the hamsters was happening to the car, i.e the car was getting improved as well.
