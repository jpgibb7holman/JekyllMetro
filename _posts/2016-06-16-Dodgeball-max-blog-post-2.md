Dodgeball max blog post 2

                 Today we had to continue with making our game on javascript but me and my friend had some issues. As we were playing a dodgeball game we needed to have an avatar that moved but we could not get ours to move. And then we had the avatars. We were able to get them to the top of the screen but once they were there, again, we could not get them to move. It is a hard game to make but we are making progress so I hope it goes well.
