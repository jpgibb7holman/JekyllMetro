Social Media

     Today in our IT lesson we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of social media. It was good for some people in some ways, some of them being you can contact friends and relatives who might live in another country or that you don't see often.You are able to keep up with news and information going on around the world and see what is going on in your friends lives (in a not creepy way).

      Unfortunately it can be used in bad ways too. You can be groomed by people to change your mind on something or, in some cases, a pedophile. It can also be used to recruit people. This is not always a bad thing as it can be for jobs but it is also used to recruit people into terrorist groups such as ISIS.
