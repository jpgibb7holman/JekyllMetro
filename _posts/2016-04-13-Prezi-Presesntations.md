Prezi Presesntations

     Today we reviewed our presentations that we had done on Prezi about the history of computers over the holidays. Prezi is an online presentation software and specialises in instead of doing slow, monotonous slides; it moves.[This is a link to my prezi presentation](https://prezi.com/9gwhiz1ga4zj/the-history-of-computers/). Our teacher gave us a lot of different things to research but there was a catch. We had to put them in chronological order which made it a lot harder.

    All in all, I quite enjoyed making my prezi although I would rather have had no homework at all.
