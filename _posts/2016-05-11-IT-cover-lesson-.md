OUR IT COVER LESSON

      Today in our IT lesson we had a cover teacher and we carried on with the work we were doing on the BBC micro:bit using Javascript. We had to do a couple of the tutorials such as Worst.Snake.Ever and Flashpoint. I enojyed them but the 5th one was very hard and I struggledquite a lot.

       Once we were done we were allowed to play the coding games I talked about in one of my other blogs which was good. All in all, it was a good IT lesson.
