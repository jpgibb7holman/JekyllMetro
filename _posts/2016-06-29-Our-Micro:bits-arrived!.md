Our Micro:bits arrived!

      All the coding I had talked about in my previous blogs was on the BBC Micro:bit website. Well, the micro:bits finally arrived! We uploaded some of our code onto it and now we can play the games we coded on the mircobit website on the actual micro:bit.

      Once we had finished this, we startted talking with our teacher about common uses of social media. We then started talking about sexting and revenge porn. Sexting is when you send an intimate photo of yourself to someone. Revenge porn is when your ex posta one of the intimate photos/videos on social media or pornagraphic websites.
