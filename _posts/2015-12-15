MY FIRST POST

      Hi. My name is James. Today in our IT lesson we started to learn about how to make our own blogs (the one you are seeing now is mine) and how to upload the things that we wanted to say on them. Part of our homework was to write up what we thought on the safety and trust you should place on the internet.

       I think that you should never place total trust in a single website as it could be inaccurate or fake. You should always check more than one website to see if each has the same facts. No website is completely secure (not even Wikipedia) so anyone with the right skills has the ability to change any website they wish, fortunately not many people do this but the fact is that they can. This was actually proven when someone hacked into the Apple Terms and Conditions and wrote, "I hereby bequeath my soul to Apple", and that was there for three months, so for three months Apple owned millions of people's souls worldwide. Which I think is absolutely awesome.
